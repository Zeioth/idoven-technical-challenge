## Introduction
This code has been generated from
[these](https://github.com/idoven/backend-challenge/tree/main) requisites
as part of the technical interview for the startup Idoven.

## How to use
Before starting you might need a couple of system dependencies

```
sudo apt install docker virtualenv
```

Now we can create and enable a virtualenv to install the dependencies with

```sh
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install fastapi python-multipart asyncpg databases psycopg2 asyncpg sqlalchemy python-passlib jose pytest ptw alembic
```

Start the database

```sh
docker run -e POSTGRES_DB=idovendb -e POSTGRES_USER=apiuser -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=apipassword -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
```

Start the FastAPI server
```
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Once the FastAPI server is running you can run the tests

```
cd ./tests/
ptw
```

### Extra commands
Optionally you can run the project in production mode with

```
APP_ENV=production uvicorn main:app
```

Optionally you can connect to the database in interactive mode with
```
docker ps
docker exec -it <instance-id> psql -U apiuser -d idovendb
```

## Development roadmap

* **Friday**: Capture of requisites
* **Monday**: MVP
* **Tuesday**: Missing features
* **Wednesday**: Tests
* **Thursday**: Bug fixes


## Architectural decisions

* This project uses the code conventions [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).
* This project uses the docstring conventions [Google's python style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).
* The database we use is PostgreSQL.
* The ORM we use is alchemysql.
* The migration tool we use is alembic.
* The database is normalized to Boyce Codd's 3ยบ normal form.
* The database implements foreign key constraints to ensure data integrity.
* Aditional endpoint 'delete-user' to be used by users with the 'admin' role.

## Out of scope

* Database backups.
* Logging system.
* Alert system like prometheus.
* Persistent tokens. In case we plan using a load balancer for the users
microservice in the future, this would be a good idea.
* A logout endoint.
* Using email or telephone as primary key for users would be desireable.
* Before leaving staging, we must modify the tests to self-clean data.
* According to the requirements, admins can create users.
  But the requirements do not specify the fact a admin shouldn't
  probably be able to create other admins.
